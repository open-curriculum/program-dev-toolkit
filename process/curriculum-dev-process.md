### 1. Initial Curriculum Prospectus Draft

The prospecus draft is a short document describing why this curriculum should be developed, who it will involve, and what it will be like. The purpose of draft is to stoke excitement around the potential of the curriculum and to garner support for it's development.

### Market Scan

A market scan should be conducted if this curriculum will require financial resources to develop, deliver, and support. A market scan will indicate whether the program will be financially viable and deliver a return on investment. However, if the curriculum does not have drain on institutional resources (IE - assembled from Open Education Resources (OER), delivered via open-source or free platforms, free of institutional homes), then a market scan will be irrelevant as traditional economic models will not apply. 

### Curriculum Committee

The curriculum commitee will consist of a large group of people who have significant stake in the success of the program. This does not mean that the curriculum content will be developed by this committee, rather they will provide feedback and approvals of the curriculum. 

### Committee Meetings
### Curriculum Proposal
### Consultation

In a large institution, a new program may inadvertantly overlap and affect other programs and courses. Consultation is conducted to ensure that everyone in the organization has the opportunity to comment on the proposal and ensure minimal collisions. A well considered proposal will accumulate some feedback in this process, but should mostly receive a goahead signal.

### 7. Personnel
