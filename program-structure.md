##Program Structure

An interdisciplinary program incorporates two or more disiplines to offer students a breadth of learning pathways. These personalized pathways inform individual research trajectories, yet offer enough structure to encourage development of thinking capacities and production capabilities.

If there is a need to adapt existing curriculum to build a program, instructional leadership should discuss which courses from each discipline area would make sense to include as core program courses. These are the required sequential program courses. Capstone courses would require pre-requisite courses be taken before enrolling. To establish pre-requisites, evaluation of learning outcomes should be determined for capstone courses, taking into consideration the nature of the content in existing or design courses. Produciton of core courses tends to be iterative as you gain familiarity with the content of pre-requisite courses.
