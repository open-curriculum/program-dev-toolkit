# Online Program Toolkit

This project is currently tracking active development of an online program and is under constant flux. The result of this process will include methodologies, examples, and frameworks to help others build their own online programs and curriculum.

**Curriculum Components**
These define the structure of the program.

**Visual Toolkit**
The goal is to create an easy to follow visual guide and worksheets to help faculty design an online interdisciplinary program with instructional design methodologies and theory baked in. This will help alleviate gaps in instructional knowledge for those new to designing online courses or teaching in general.  This visual toolkit is under heavy design and development. 

If you are interested in collaborating on this project, `nodes_learning-tasks-development.ai` is the farthest along in development and indicative of where the visual toolkit is headed.
